# Pixel Art Maker Project:
* This is the fourth project of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

### Specifications:
*  Whole numbers in the "Height" and "Width" fields, and submitting the form, causes an empty grid to appear on the page.
* Choosing a color from the color selector and clicking on a grid square causes that grid square (and only that square) to change color.
* Event listeners are properly added to the grid squares (and not to the border or the table itself).

### How to run?
1. Download the zip file and extract into your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` into your favourite browser.
3. Choose the size of grid and click submit button and choose a color.
4. Fill the color in the grid.
